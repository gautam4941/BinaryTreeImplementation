# BinaryTreeImplementation
This Repository is all about how to Implement binary Tree as well as doing some basics problems.

Things to remember :- 
1) Add all the .java files in same package because, All ".java" files are interlinked and dependent on each other.

2) Value Inseretion is getting done automatically using Java.util.Random().
So, Don't bother about automatic input.

3) Binary Tree Implementation :- 1.Insert, 2.Display

4) Extra Features :- 1.Number of Nodes, 2.No. of Leaf Nodes, 3.Maximum Number, 4.Find Path, 5.Level of Binary Tree

Very Soon few More feature will be added. Thanks For Visiting My Repository. Hope you will visit Again ..
